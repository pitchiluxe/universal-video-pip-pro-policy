  <h1>Universal Video PiP PRO – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>This browser extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data about you.</p>

  <p>The extension only stores a small set of user-chosen settings (such as whether auto
  Picture-in-Picture on scroll or on tab switch is enabled) using the browser’s built-in
  <code>chrome.storage.sync</code> API. These settings are used solely to control the behavior of the
  extension and may sync between your own devices via your browser account.</p>

  <p>The extension does not send any data to external servers, does not use analytics, and does
  not display ads.</p>

  <p>If you have questions about this policy, you can contact the developer at:
  <a href="mailto:[YOUR_EMAIL]">[YOUR_EMAIL]</a>.</p>
