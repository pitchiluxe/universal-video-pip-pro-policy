# Universal Video PiP PRO – Privacy Policy

Universal Video PiP PRO does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data about you.

The extension only stores a small set of user‑chosen settings (for example, whether auto
Picture‑in‑Picture on scroll or on tab switch is enabled) using the browser’s built‑in
`chrome.storage.sync` API. These settings are used solely to control the behavior of the
extension and may sync between your own devices via your browser account.

The extension does **not**:
- Collect personally identifiable information
- Collect browsing history for analytics or profiling
- Record keystrokes, mouse movements, or other user activity
- Send any data to external servers
- Display ads or use third‑party tracking scripts

For the published policy used in the Chrome Web Store and other stores, see:
